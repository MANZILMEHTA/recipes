    <br></br>
    <li><span style="background-color:black">After switching off the flame, add vinegar (60 ml) and keep stirring it for 10 minutes.</li>
      <br></br>
    <li><span style="background-color:black">Now you can see that milk is curdled. So now take a bowl, keep strainer on it and keep a thin cloth in strainer.</li>
      <br></br>
    <li><span style="background-color:black">Now strain the curdled milk.Then squeeze the cloth and remove excess of water from it.</li>
      <br></br>
    <li><span style="background-color:black">Now take two bowls. The first bowl is filled with 3 cups (600 ml) of boiling hot water and the second bowl is filled 3 cups (600 ml) of ice cold water.</li>
      <br></br>
    <li><span style="background-color:black">The curd which is left in the cloth will be in shape of a ball. Pick the ball of curd lightly and carefully.Then dip it in hot boiling water bowl for 2 minutes and meanwhile keep stirring it lightly with the help of spoon, ensuring that BALL DOES NOT BREAK. </li>
      <br></br>
    <li><span style="background-color:black">Now after 2 minutes,Remove the ball and put it again in cloth and squeeze it to remove water. transfer that ball into ice cold chilled water bowl for 2 minutes and again stir it lightly ensuring that ball does not break.<br> Take the ball out and put it in between your palms of both hands.

      <br></br>
    <li><span style="background-color:black">Once you are done with this process wrap your cheese into a plastic wrap tightly such that no air should be there inside the wrap.</li>
